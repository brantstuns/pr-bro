Pull request helper script. Basically just makes sure your tests run before pushing and that you don't try any funny business with the master branch.

**INSTALLATION**
Basically just clone this and from the repo run `ln -s ./pr-bro /usr/local/bin/pr-bro`
Make sure /usr/local/bin or $HOME/bin if you prefer is on your $PATH.

use it by running `pr-bro` in a git repo you want to prep for opening a pr with.
